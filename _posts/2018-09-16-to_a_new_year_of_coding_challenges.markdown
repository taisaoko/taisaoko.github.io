My name is Vic Danh and I'm a molecular biologist by years of schooling. I live in Dayton, Ohio and I've always fascinated by the multi-faceted applications of coding and programming. I've always considered myself a moderate nerd and a lover of knowledge. I thought challenging myself to learn programming deeply and completely will open my mind to a new field of application science.

As a kid, I always gravitated toward science and healthcare. The sense of duty and responsibility propelled toward a career in molecular biology and now healthcare as a medical technologist. However, coding is something that I feel that I was lacking in school. It is a more applicable form of math that does not get taught in school as much as it should. And that is the reason why I have enrolled in the FlatIron program of Web Development.

I started this first blog later than most students because of my busy work schedule, but the more I learn coding, the more I enjoyed solving problems and learning the different ways to tackle one coding challenge. I am more assured that I am equipped with the tools to succeed in this new field, with many resources from fellow students and technical coaches.

Let us begin, cheers to the near future where I can apply my analytical mind and science background to the world of programming!
